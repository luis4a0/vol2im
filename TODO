Goals before 1.0:
* Implement frontends for different input formats.
* Improve the interface: read as many input slices as needed and choose which
slices to output.
* Permit to save the data structure and use it as input.

Future goals:
* Accept more input and output formats beyond png (tiff and jpeg at least).
* Add data structure compression, via zlib.
* Choose the number of bits used for internal representation and output.
