Vol2im compiles with any ANSI-compliant compiler (gcc, icc, vc). It needs the
libpng library ( http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html ).

To configure, change the paths in the Makefile to suit your needs. Then, run
'make' to compile and link dynamically or 'make static' to compile and link
statically.

No installation is needed, although you can copy the binary produced to any
executable path.
